# How to measure the strength of the symptoms?

## inexistent

no or inconsequential manifestations of ur-fascist symptoms

## weak

Individuals, small movements, fringe parties with no political representation, occasional demonstrations. Attacks against foreigners are rare and clearly condemned by mainstream politics and media.  

## medium

Organisations with fascist traits have  elected members of parliaments, appear regularly in the media. Verbal and physical attacks against modern culture, non standard behaviour, foreigners are frequent and met with understanding. Politics is understood as permanent fight. All or nothing is better then a compromise.   

## strong

Organisations with fascist traits are part of the government, have their own media. They use their inside knowledge and their power to change the system wherever it is possible. 

## overwhelming

Organisations with fascist traits have a political majority. They are able to change the constitution and laws, replace members of the administration and the courts, control media etc. The opposition is  more and more criminalized.
