20 years after Eco wrote his essay: How to recognize symptoms of ur-fascism? 

## 1. Cult of Tradition

Myths are more important than historical facts. History is glorified as a constant but successful struggle against intruders and for independence. Organisazions adorn themselves with emblems and artefacts of the glorius past. 

## 2. Rejection of modernism

Modern society is depicted as degenerate. Cities are hotspots of sin and crime. The remedy is to return to traditional strong values. Believes are better than arguments. 

## 3. Cult of Action for Action's sake

Reflecting before acting is weak. Enough talk, it is time to act regardless the consequences. Call forleaders who act. 

## 4. Disagreement is treason

The leader knows what is best for the people. Doubts are a sign of weakness. Disagreement is poisonous. It is either misguided believe or outright treason. 

## 5. Appealing against intruders

Foreigners are intruders. They  want to profit from  the wealth. Often they are depicted as vermin. 

## 6. Appealing to a frustrated middle class

The family, the small business, the hard working middle class is in danger. It must be protected from overzealous bureaucracy, greedy government, tax burdens, thieves and parasites.    

## 7. Obsession with a plot

The opposition is an instrument of foreign powers or secret organisations with tremendous wealth and strong beliefs.  

## 8. Over- and underestimating the enemy

The enemie is richer and better equipped. But he is also degenerated and therefore we will succed. 

## 9. Live is a struggle

Life is preperation for war and permanent warfare. Who is not for us is against us. Compromise is a sign of weakness, pacifism is a curse. 

## 10. Contempt for the weak

Poverty and sickness are consequences of moral weakness. Real refugies and real victims deserve help but most are freeloaders.     

## 11. Worship of heroism and death

Dying for the cause is the ultimate, heroic sacrifice. Beeing right and loosing a battle is more important than finding a compromise everybody can live with. 

## 12. Disdain of women and nonstandard sexual habits

The family is sacred. Sexual freedom is degenerate. Homosexuality and other non-standard sexual habits are condemned and punished. 

## 13. Disdain for the separation of power

Democratically elected parliaments and governments are becoming suspect. It becomes doubtful that they  represent the true will of the people. Courts are willing servants of the ruling class. The system is corrupt and must be cleansed. 

##Â 14. Newspeak

Whoever critzies the party or the movement is ridiculed and taunted. Schoolbooks are cleansed of deviating content and rewritten.
