# Ur-Fascism

Fascism has become an all purpose term. And all purpose terms are useless. The weakness of the term probably hurts them the most who try to identify and fight fascims. And it helps them who deserve to be labeled as "fascists". 

The more important it is to put the term "fasiscm" back on its feet. 

But how?

"The fascist game can be played in many forms, and the name of the game does not change," writes Umberto Eco in his article "Ur-Fascism", published in "The New York Times Review of Books" on June 22, 1995. "But in spites of this fuzziness, I think is is possible to outline a list of features that are typical of what I would like to call Ur-Fascism, or Eternal Fascism."

Eco admits, that the features cannot be organized into a system: "Many of them contradict each other, and are also typical  of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism." 

So why should such a list be helpful?

Because it is enough that one of these features is present to allow fascism to coagulate around it, Eco answers.
