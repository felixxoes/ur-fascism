# Ur-Fascism

Fascism has become an all purpose term. And all purpose terms are useless. The weakness of the term probably hurts them the most who try to identify and fight fascims. And it helps them who deserve to be labeled as "fascists". 

The more important it is to put the term "fasiscm" back on its feet. 

But how?

"The fascist game can be played in many forms, and the name of the game does not change," writes Umberto Eco in his article "Ur-Fascism", published in "The New York Times Review of Books" on June 22, 1995 http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/. "But in spites of this fuzziness, I think is is possible to outline a list of features that are typical of what I would like to call Ur-Fascism, or Eternal Fascism."

Eco admits, that the features cannot be organized into a system: "Many of them contradict each other, and are also typical  of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism." 

So why should such a list be helpful?

Because it is enough that one of these features is present to allow fascism to coagulate around it, Eco answers. 

## The List

Cult of Tradition
Rejection of modernism
Cult of Action for Action's sake
Disagreement is treason
Appealing against intruders
Appealing to a frustrated middle class
Obsession with a plot
Over- and underestimating the enemy
Live is a struggle
Contempt for the weak
Worship of heroism and death
Disdain of women and nonstandard sexual habits
Disdain for the separation of power
Newspeak

## Eco's warning

Ur-Fascism is still aorund us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be so much easier, for us, if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, "I want to reopen Auschwitz, I want the Black Shirts to parade again in the Italian squares." Life is not that simple, writes Eco. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises.

# The Goal of the Project

As Eco says Fascism can coagulate aorund any one of the elememts he identified as features of Ur-Fascism. It should be interesting to look for this features in the societies we live and see how far they are grown. Therefore, the goal of the project is to create a tool, which allows people to do that.
