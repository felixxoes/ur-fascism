# Ur-Fascism

Fascism has become an all purpose term. And all purpose terms are useless. The weakness of the term probably hurts them the most who try to identify and fight fascims. And it helps them who deserve to be labeled as "fascists". 

The more important it is to put the term "fasiscm" back on its feet. 

But how?

"The fascist game can be played in many forms, and the name of the game does not change," writes Umberto Eco in his article "Ur-Fascism", published in "The New York Times Review of Books" on June 22, 1995 http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/. "But in spites of this fuzziness, I think is is possible to outline a list of features that are typical of what I would like to call Ur-Fascism, or Eternal Fascism."

Eco admits, that the features cannot be organized into a system: "Many of them contradict each other, and are also typical  of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism." 

So why should such a list be helpful?

Because it is enough that one of these features is present to allow fascism to coagulate around it, Eco answers. 

## The List

1. Cult of Tradition
2. Rejection of modernism
3. Cult of Action for Action's sake
4. Disagreement is treason
5. Appealing against intruders
6. Appealing to a frustrated middle class
7. Obsession with a plot
8. Over- and underestimating the enemy
9. Live is a struggle
10. Contempt for the weak
11. Worship of heroism and death
12. Disdain of women and nonstandard sexual habits
13. Disdain for the separation of power
14. Newspeak

## Eco's warning

Ur-Fascism is still aorund us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be so much easier, for us, if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, "I want to reopen Auschwitz, I want the Black Shirts to parade again in the Italian squares." Life is not that simple, writes Eco. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises.

# The Goal of the Project

As Eco says, Fascism can coagulate aorund any one of the elememts he identified as features of Ur-Fascism. It should be interesting to look for this features in the societies we live in and see how far they are grown. Therefore, the goal of the project is to create a tool, which allows people to evaluate political movements. 

How does this tool work?

Firstly the users choose a political movement they would like to evaluate.

Secondly they give an estimate for each item on Eco's list. "On a scale of 1 to 6 how strongly is XYZ obsessed with a plot?" 

Thirdly the tool creates a graphic representation of the evaluation. 

Finally the result of the individual evaluation is mapped onto all previous evaluations of the movement. 

## Steps 

1. It is necesseray to write very short stories for each item on the list. The story gives the user a clear understanding what is meant. 
2. It should be decided what is important to know about the people who us the tool. 
3. Programming the tool.
4. Designing the interface.
5. See how it works.
